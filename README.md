# Automation Engineer Home Assignment - Netanel's Solution

This is my solution to the Unity's Automation Engineer Home Assignment.
I've used Java 11 and gradle with Kotlin syntax.

## Solution Structure
All the relevant code is under `src/test/java/org/example`
* UI code (POM files and Selenium test) is under the `UI` folder.
* API code (API test) is under the `API` folder.

### UI - Using Selenium
In order to run the UI test, run the `src/test/java/org/example/UI/tests/SeleniumTests.java` class (or the `unityAssignmentTest` test there).

### API - Using java.net utils
In order to run the API test, run the `src/test/java/org/example/UI/tests/ApiTests.java` class (or the `apiTest` test there).
